            <p>Hi! It’s wonderful to meet you: I’m Annika. I’m a graduating senior <i>(2nd year transfer!</i>) with an English major and Conservation Biology minor. I love animals, and I have two wonderful old dogs, Ollie and Sophie, back at home. I also love art (I like to read, write, and draw, though I’m not particularly good at any of them), and my favorite food is probably strawberries. I also like to bake: here's a <a href="https://foodal.com/recipes/breakfast/vegan-belgian-waffles/" target="_blank">link to my favorite waffle recipe!</a> </p>
            <p>I am passionate about lots of things, but to sum everything up as efficiently as possible, my main goal is to promote <b>empathy</b> for everything on the Earth. I know that sounds <i>pretentious,</i> but all it really means is making sure that the world is <b>equitable and open to everything!</b> I’m a writer at heart, so my preferred medium for this is storytelling, but I’m hoping to learn about coding and digital mapping as another medium to promote empathy through social and environmental justice endeavors. Therefore, my goal for this course is to be able to make websites and digital maps using HTML, Javascript, and CSS and learn how to apply them to my passion. </p>
