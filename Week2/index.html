		<h2>So where is my home, really?</h2>
		<p> I was born on the East Coast of the US and, throughout my life, have slowly travelled westward until I ended up here in Los Angeles! I call this page My Homes because it documents all the places I have lived, but, the truth is, all these places have been bonus explorations where I've met lifelong friends and developed my character. My real home, however, is the place where those I love reside!</p>

				'description': "I lived in Mt. Laurel between 1 and 7 years old. I was a shy kid who wasn't great at socializing, but I discovered other passions: particularly the vibrant world of reading! My mom would take me to the library twice a week, and I'd always pick up a stack of books which reached taller than my head when I lifted them up.",

I have fond memories of riding my bike to the candy store after school and playing Yu-Gi-Oh with my friends on the playground. One year, I met and adopted the two great loves of my life, my dogs Ollie and Sophie.",

				'description': "From 11 to 15 years old, I lived in Oak Brook. This is the place where I had to start to learn to grow up, to take the good with the bad, to get through the hard times and accept whatever result comes out on the other end. I weathered a lot of cold winters there and am a better person for them.",

				'description': "I lived in Irvine from 15 to 19 years old. At first when I moved there, I was shocked because it felt almost like moving to a different country: the plants and buildings around me looked so different! Nonetheless, I have a soft spot in my heart for Irvine, because it's the place where I gained many valuable friendships and learned to depend on other people when the times get tough.",

				'description': "For the last year or so, Los Angeles has been my home. It's an awfully short amount of time to be able to call a place a home, but, as a transfer student during the pandemic, this is all the time I have! I definitely don't think my chapter in LA is over, and I still have lots to learn here.",
