		<h2>So where is my home, really?</h2>
		<p> I was born on the East Coast of the US and, throughout my life, have slowly travelled westward until I ended up here in Los Angeles! I call this page My Homes because it documents all the places I have lived, but, the truth is, all these places have been bonus explorations where I've met lifelong friends and developed my character. My real home, however, is the place where those I love reside!</p>
