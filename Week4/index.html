			The Southern Sea Otter, <i>Enhydra lutris nereis</i>
        </h2>
		<h3>
			Sea otter populations are on the decline.
		</h3>
		<p> The IUCN categorizes sea otters as in danger of extinction: in fact, according to the IUCN, the most recent population measurement was 125,831, in 2012, and the population has been in decline in the 9 years since. </p> 
		<p>
			Because they reside primarily in the North Pacific, sea otters face a variety of threats associated with climate change and human effects in the region. These include the transfer of parasites from other regions of the globe, severe weather events associated with climate change, ocean acidification, pathogen transport, invasive species, and biotoxins. Humans are also a major threat for sea otters, as oil spills and fishing nets each have caused significant mortality. 
		</p>

			Southern Sea Otters are otters that live along the California coast. Like other otters, Southern Sea otters are faced with the threat of extinction. Click below to see the locations where Southern Sea Otters have been observed in the last two years.
